<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">W</span>inter is coming ;-) To be honest: It is already here</p>

As It is nearly December, and the weather in Bergen has become a lot colder, i decided to write about two really Norwegian activities:

- Skiing
- and Cabin trips.

And in the best case you combine both of these things. So did I last weekend when I joined a trip, organized by BSI Friluft.
BSI (Bergen Students Idretsslag) roughly translates to Bergen stuend sports, which is a kind sports club primiraly targeted at students,
but also available for non-students. They have several groups for different kinds of sports and of course they have a group for the
Norwegian Friluftsliv as well, i.e. covering climbing, hiking, skiing or just beeing outdoors.
The great thing about this group, beside of course nice people and great trip offers, is that they own a cabin somewhere in the wilderness 
beside the railway track between Oslo and Bergen. 
The exact stop i called Hallingsskeid. It is two and a half hours from Bergen and when you embark there, you will find pretty much nothing more then a lonely waiting room.
the picture below might give an impression.

Behind this waiting room you will find yourself pretty much in the middle of nowhere. 
There are only a handful of cabin distributed over the place and of course faboulose nature.
The last few weeks have been pretty rough winter weather been there, which transformed the landscape into an iconic winter wonderland.
A great place to take on you Fjellski (a combination between a classic "Langlaufski" and an alpine "carving" ski) and walk up the next hill.
When you reach the top, you eat your frozen sandwhich and eat chocolate (usually Kvikk Lunsj, the norwegian variant of Kit Kat, which everzone loves here).
To get back down you remove the "Fell" and ride down.
This is actually pretty hard, normal boots only one joint, i fell a lot

After the skiing you get back to your cabin.
When you reach the cabin, it will be horribly cold.
To be clear, the idea of a cabin is that it lacks all the benefits of civilization:
Electricity,
Water
and Heating

To get water you have to smelt snow, to have it warm you fire up the oven and electricity is honestly speaking sometimes a pleasure to dont have it available.
So when you set up the oven and lighted some candles you start to enjoy yourself:
This then is called "hyttekos".
So It might sound that this a little bit strange, somehow going "frivillig" back to medieval circumstances, wearing multiple clothing layers and being happy not be out in cold and dark night is actually prettz cosy.
