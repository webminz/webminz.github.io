title:  "Guide: Work Immigration in Norway for EU-citizen"
--- 

_Disclaimer: The following has been restored from an earlier Blog-based version of my personal homepage. Thus, the content could be partly outdated (dated: 21st December 2017). However, I thought it might be still useful for people finding themselves in a similar immigration situation in Norway..._

Even though the Norwegian economy pretty much is built on importing skilled foreign workers, it is at the same time not sooo easy to immigrate to Norway as a professional foreign worker. Therefore, I thought to share my experiences, which might be helpful for others who want to live and work in Norway for a longer time (more than six months). Thus, the following guideline is applicable at least for EU citizens who found a permanent working position in Norway and is described for legislation valid in the fall of 2017.

So lets, get started: First I would recommend to get yourself a **passport** from your country. Even though most places state that you can also use your **national identity card**, but I also heard of problems with that such that I will base this guideline upon the possession of a passport.

As this guideline is developed for people who already found a job, therefore assuming you have a **contract of employment**:

The second thing you will need now is actually a place to live ;-P
Though buying a house in Norway might be an option sometime in the future, I think the most reasonable thing when first coming to Norway is to rent a flat. Again there a several possibilities:

- Either you rent a room in a flat-share, which is usually much cheaper but also gives you maybe less privacy and the like
- You rent a flat, apartment or a house. 

If you go for the first option then the website [hybel.no](https://www.hybel.no) is the designated place to search for flat-shares.
If you want an apartment on your own, you should try out [Finn.no](https://www.finn.no). Basically Finn is the Norwegian _ebay_,therefore you will not only find apartments there but also cars, furniture and any kind of stuff. 

Found an apartment? Congratulations! This means you now have a **rental contract**.

With this you are now ready to register as foreign worker to get your **work permit**. 
This can be done under the following Link: [Registration as as foreign worker](https://selfservice.udi.no/en-gb/)
You should be able to fill in the forms there with the information from you passport, the contract of employment and the rental contract. You can ask your employer for his organizational registration number if it is not stated on the contract of employment.
After that, you have to book an appointment with the police to get your work permit.
The appointment is pretty simple: you hand them the requested documents and voilà you get a work permit.
The whole procedure takes max. 5 min, however, these appointments are vary rare and really requested (at least in larger cities), therefore you should book the appointment as early as possible before coming to Norway, as this appointment is the central key to get most important thing: A permanent personal **ID number**.
For the appointment you need a **passport** and the **proof of employment (Ansettelsesbevis for EØS/EFTA-borgere)**.
This form can be downloaded [here](https://www.udi.no/globalassets/global/skjemaer/ansettelsesbevis-eos-efta-gp7116-b.pdf) and has to be filled out by your employer.

All the things described above can be done without being in Norway and therefore also should be done in advance.
Now we will come to the things that you have to do as soon as you arrive in Norway.

To get paid, you need a **tax card (Skattekort)**.
I would recommend heading to the UDI on one of your first days in Norway and hand in the following [form](http://www.skatteetaten.no/globalassets/Skjemaer/alltid/RF1209E.pdf).
You also have to bring your **passport** and the **employment contract**, maybe you also have to show the **rental contract** to proof that the address is correct.
After approximately one week, you and also your employer will receive the tax card.
If you hav not received an ID number until now, at this point you will get a *temporary* ID number, the so called **D-Number**.

Actually, most organizations did not accept a D-number as a substitute for the ID-number, but you can give it a try ;-)
A few banks also allow you to open an account with just a D-Number, for example [SR1](https://www.sparebank1.no/).

Now, while waiting for your appointment with the police, you can consider getting a Norwegian telephone number.
It is required if you want to use the very convenient and important identification systems _BankID på mobil_ as well as the very convenient payment system _Vipps_. Furthermore, if you want to register on sites like Finn.no, you also have to have a Norwegian number. All in all, it definitely pays off to have one.
There are either prepaid cards or subscription plans. 
Please note that for a subscription plan again, Telenor or other cheaper contractors on the internet like Chess, Ice.net, etc. you again need the permanent ID-number. Some companies however, for example Telia, allow you to get a subscription without these things (You still need a passport, contract of employment with salary statement and housing contract), though.

When coming to the big day of your police appointment, make sure that you have all your important documents at hand.
I also would recommend to come a bit earlier not just to be sure but also to fill out this [form](http://www.skatteetaten.no/globalassets/Skjemaer/alltid/RF-1401E.pdf), which states your move to Norway.
Directly after your police appointment (The police officer on the desk can directly forward you to the UDI desk) you can hand in this form at the UDI desk and also have supply them with the following documents:
- **Passport** or **national id card**
- Registration certificate from the police
- the **rental contract** of your apartment
- the **contract of employment**

Now you will be registered in the central person register *Folkeregisteret* and you will finally you get a permanent ID-Number.
This number finally empowers you to do all important things: Get a mobile number, Open a Bank account, etc.
Also you will be assigned a *fastlege*, i.e. you assigned house doctor. 
Thus, you don't have go to the Legevakt, i.e. the emergency room, if you need medical treatment. 
If you don't like your fastlege, you are allowed to request another doctor twice a year.

When you have a bank account and your ID number, I highly recommend to send your employer this information, such that you can receive your salary.

Congratulations, now you can finally start living in Norway!

Additionally, I would recommend the organize the following things in order to make your life even more convenient.

## BankID på mobil

To log into your bank account you will get a token (*Kodebrike*), which generates a one-time password.
Also, as every major public service is connected, you can also use it to log in at the tax authority, the social security authorities, the health-authorities and many more.
As the small token is usually very small and therefore easy to lose and forget and you will need BankID quite often, you should definetly set up BankID på mobil. 
For this you need a Norwegian number and the regular BankID.
Just go to the following website and follow the instructions.

## European Health insurance card

If you are traveling in Europe and you need medical treatment it is nice to have this card (In countries like Germany you usually get this card automatically).
In Norway you explicitely have to order this card.
You can do this under the following link.

## Digipost

If you want to post from the official institutions even faster and/or if you want to reduce the amount of produced paper, you should sing up at Digipost. 
You just need your BankID and follow the instructions at the following website.
Afterwards you get all important official mail in electronic form there.

## Vipps

As you might already have noticed: People in Norway seldomly use cash.
This creates new requirements to easily transfer money to your friend, e.g. if they buy something for you. 
It is quite cumbersome to go to you online banking to transfer them the money. 
Thankfully, there is Vipps. 
An app you can register yourself with a Norwegian number and a Norwegian bank account.
It allows you to easily send your friends money, or receive money from them.
Also some shops allow to pay with Vipps.
I highly recommend it as it makes your life even easier.

# Summary

Finally: All this sound very complicated? Don't worry you will quickly get into it. 
Furthermore, I created this diagram, which shows the important documents you need and the causal order in which you have to perform this activities:

<figure>
	<img src="{{ '/assets/img/immigration-diagram.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt=""> 
	<figcaption><strong>Fig:</strong> Overview of activities and documents during the immigration process</figcaption>
</figure>

Activities are denoted by ellipses, A physical printed document, which is required during an activity has the shape of a note, and electronically centrally stored information is denoted by a cylinder (database). The arrows show the causality or requirements between activities and resources. A dashed arrow denotes that this document can be requested from the issuer of the source document.

Maybe computer scientist are more comfortable with this representation. 
If the diagram confuses you, just ignore it ;-)

Cheers,
Patrick
