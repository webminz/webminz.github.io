<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">W</span> inter is coming ;-) Ok, to be honest: It is already here! As It is nearly December (exactly 30 days until Christmas), and the temperatures in Bergen have become a lot colder.
</p>

So, i decided to write about two really Norwegian winter activities:

- Skiing
- and Cabin trips.

And in the best case you combine both of these things. 
So did I last weekend when I joined a trip, organized by [BSI Friluft](https://bsifriluft.no/).
BSI (_Bergen StudentIdrettslag_) roughly translates to _Bergen student sports club_, which is a kind of a sports club primarily targeted at students, but also available for non-students. 
They have several groups for different kinds of sports and of course there is group for the Norwegian **Friluftsliv** as well, i.e. covering climbing, hiking, skiing or just being outdoors.
The great thing about this particular group, of course besides nice people and great trip offers, is that they own a cabin somewhere in the wilderness besides the railway track between Oslo and Bergen. 
The exact stop i called [Hallingsskeid](https://www.google.no/maps/place/Hallingskeid/@60.66794,7.2503659,17z/). 
It is two and a half hours from Bergen and when you embark there, you will find pretty much nothing more then a lonely waiting room.
The picture below might give an impression.

Behind this waiting room you will find yourself pretty much in the middle of nowhere. 
There are only a handful of cabins, sparsely distributed over the place and of course fabulous nature.
The last few weeks have been pretty rough winter weather been there, which transformed the landscape into an iconic winter wonderland.

A great place to put on your _Fjellski_ (a combination between a classic "Langlaufski" and an alpine "carving" ski) and walk up the next hill.
When you reach the top, you eat your sandwich (which is very likely frozen in the meantime) and eat chocolate (usually Kvikk Lunsj, which is a Norwegian variant of Kit Kat and is beloved from every Norwegian).

To get back down into the valley you remove the skins from your skis, which helped you to get up.
Riding _Fjellski_ is actually pretty hard, even if you are used to classic alpine skiing. 
You don't have a binding or solid boots, which gives you control over the ski. 
The boots you are using are basically regular hiking boots, which contain a tiny joint next to your toes.
To safely get down the mountain, you need the so called _Telemark_ technique.
Of course I wasn't aware of this technique, therefore I had a lot of face plants, which hasn't been that bad though because landing in the snow was pretty soft.
In any case it was a lot of fun :)

After a long day of skiing, you of course have to sleep and eat somewhere.
This is were the cabin comes into the game.
The cabin is a really Norwegian thing and can be seen as simplified house, i.e. it is a lot smaller, it has no electricity, no running water, no central heating and if you have to go to the toilet, you'll have to do this on a pit latrine.
I just lacks all the "benefits" of civilization.

Thus, the first time you reach your cabin it is horribly cold.
So, you will have to make a fire first.
Afterwards, if you need water to drink, clean or cook, you of course have to melt some snow first.
Furthermore a head lamp is mandatory otherwise you won't find anything, as sunshine hours are not that long in the north in the winter.
Finally, if you after dinner have to relief yourself, make sure to plan a lit ahead, as the latrine is usually 50-100 meters away.
Assuming you have fresh snow reaching the height of your knees, this walk might take some time.

So, you might ask: Why should one voluntarily do this?
Because it is cosy (our _koselig_ as the Norwegians would say).
It is actually really relaxing to be away from civilization for a while, sitting around the oven, drinking maybe a glass of wine and just be happy that you don't have to be outside ;-)
The concrete word describing this feeling is _hyttekos_.

So, this was a little introduction into typical activities in the Norwegian winter.
Maybe some Norwegian reader could judge if this description is accurate :P

Ah, not to forget: Each cabin needs a pair of really wooden old skis on the wall of course!

The following music video from the Norwegian comedy duo _Ylvis_ (who are also from Bergen by the way), might explain the idea of the cabin (hytte) further: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua1FAlHt_Ys)

See you!
