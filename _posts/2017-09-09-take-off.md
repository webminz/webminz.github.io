Now, as i am writing these lines, i am sitting somewhere at the Amsterdam Airport waiting for my onward flight to Bergen and i have to ask myself the question:

_"Was it a good decision to make this step ?!"_

Moving to a cold and rainy country, whose language i don't speak and without knowing nearly anyone else than my supervisors and one of my new flat-mates ?!
And in combination a lot of additional thoughts are running through my head: 
How will my new life be like?
Will i like Norway? 
Will my new flat-mates like me?
How will the work at the university be like?
How demanding will the PhD be?

But the more i am thinking about it, i have to acknowledge that without making this move, i wouldn't have been able to answer all these questions.
So i think it is the best to now look forward from now on and await the coming adventure with pleasant anticipation.

I think i will have a lot more to tell in a few days, so stay tuned!
