title:  "Spring Europe Travel: Part One"

The first part of my journey through Europe this April is over. Thus, it is about time to report about this trip. 
More precisely the section from Hanover back to Bergen.  

I am quite used to this trip now but always took the plane. For the first time now, I did this trip the traditional way by taking car and boat. The story behind this was, that I somehow managed to convince my parents to visit me in Bergen by car, which in turn enables to use the available space of the car to transport some of my bulky belongings, which are a bit messy to transport in a plane, e.g. bicycles and kayaks :P
However, this choice of transportation devices results in a significant increase of the total travel time: ~3-4h vs. nearly 2 days. 

If you decide for this choice of transportation, you first have to drive all the way up to Hirsthals (Denmark), which is around 3,5h hours from Hanover (usually more because of all the construction sites on the German highways) on the busy German "Autobahn" to the Danish border and then 3 a bit more relaxed hours crossing Denmark. On arriving in Hirtshals, your next choices are two different ferry lines: You either want to take the rather short [Colorline](https://www.colorline.com) directly to Kristiansand (approx. 4h) or take the [Fjordline](https://www.fjordline.com), which carries you all the way directly into the Bergen harbor (= city center). I am not a hundred percent sure, but concerning the relatively slow traveling speed on Norwegian roads and all the road tolls, I consider the cheaper and under certain circumstances also the faster alternative from Hirtshals to Bergen. It was also out choice for this trip.

Moreover, I want to make a short report on my one time experience with this ferry boat. Normally, I would not regard this as something special but as all my previous experiences on the Mediterranean Sea between Italy in Greece were really horrible, I want to point out how positively surprised I was. The boarding worked smoothly, everything seemed to be really well organized and it was quite clean on board (opposed to previous experiences). Furthermore, the ship engine is really quite and there is no diesel smell at all because they seem to use some futuristic gas without smell. The cabins are quite narrow, but still have place for up to four people via an interesting foldable, stacked bed construction. Prices on board a high but not horribly high. At least they are lower than in Norway, resulting in the bar filled with Norwegians during the night ;-)
The usual schedule for traveling to Norway with Fjordline is that you board in the evening around seven, sail during the night and arrive in Bergen on the next day around lunchtime. 
A bit long, but relaxing way to travel.

So, we arrived in Bergen on Easter Monday with marvelous weather. Actually, several people told me that there was brilliant weather in Bergen during the Easter holiday, while in Germany we had quite bad weather. 
The fact that we arrived during Easter holiday made it a bit more difficult to find a restaurant as **every** Norwegian spends his Easter skiing at his cabin in mountains. But in the end we managed to find a nice restaurant (even with traditional Norwegian cuisine).
The next days were dedicated to showing my parents a bit of Norway, its Fjords and Bergen (including its famous weather). I am slowly getting enough background knowledge that I can function as a tourist guide :D But also admit that there are still a lot of things to learn for me as well. For example,  I had not been to any museum in Bergen yet. The last week allowed me to remove some of them from my bucket list. 
Also I finally had an incentive to take the funicular to the top of Ulriken, i.e. with 643 meters the highest "mountain" around Bergen), which offers a really nice view:
To recommend! (at least if there is no giant cloud on the top reducing the sight from several kilometers to 3 meters)

Any last words, hmm, yeah maybe that this last week made it more clear that I really to long for Spring. Norway is still gripped by the Winter, which was really nice for a long time because it enabled a lot of skiing. But I have to admit that I get a bit tired and would like to have some warmer temperatures. Maybe the upcoming trips in the South of Europe will give me a taste of this...
