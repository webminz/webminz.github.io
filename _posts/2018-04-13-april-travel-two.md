While writing this lines, I am sitting at the Nice airport waiting for my flight to Thessaloniki.
Thus, it is about time to report on my last week in Nice (France).
And indeed, I made a lot of new experiences/insights.

First of all, I think that Nice could be a nice city. Under the following preconditions:

- You have nice weather.
- You actually have time for leisure and strolling around.
- You speak some French
- You have an over average income
- (and really nice to have: some company interested in art/culture and cuisine)

Evidence for this is given by my own subjective experience.
I arrived in Nice on Saturday early noon which meant that I had at least one and half days of free time before the conference and also one and a half days with reasonable weather as well (more on the weather later ;-)). 
I tried to use it to walk a bit around the small castle hill next to the old town center, the main parks and the Promenade, which is actually nice. 
The only drawback was that it is apparently not allowed to bath at the beach there (also the weather was not that inviting).
Furthermore, the Cote d'Azure does not look like a place to make beach holiday, as it mostly gravel and the whole shoreline is betonated. 
However, what I really enjoyed was the cuisine there. Especially the old town center hosts plenty of inviting restaurants, offering an interesting mix of seafood, mediterranean and french specialities. The only drawback is that it is quite pricy. In fact, I was really surprised because when traveling from Norway you usually expect lower prices, but in Nice (at least in the central touristic places I have been to) I had to experience almost the same prices as in Norwegian restaurants.
So I think, it might be possible to get a "hang" of this city, when you have a bit more background knowledge (an consider yourself as a little bit upperclass posh maybe ;-)). 
I must admit that I do not speak any French, are not so familiar with the Cote d'Azur lifestyle and also did not inform myself enough what to do and to eat in Nice.
As said before, these first two days I was traveling on my own. 
Besides the fair advantages of traveling alone, there is also a major drawback: 
You are alone. 
There is no one also to share your experiences with. 
I think someone, with some background to introduce me to Nice would have been nice the first days on Nice.

But this trip was not about holiday, right ?!

On Monday, finally, the conference started (actually the first two days were dedicated to Workshops. The main conference was only Wednesday and Thursday).
And with the begin of the conference, the rain came. 
Precisely, it started Sunday night and did not stopped until, well _today_.
Thus, we basically had almost one week of original Bergen weather in France (while of course, at the same time there was really nice weather in Bergen).

However, this was not a big problem: 
Because attending a conference basically means that you spend the whole day inside a convention center. 
Apart from that, I think conferences are really nice:
You get to listen to (mostly) interesting talks by smart people and you also get a lot of good food.
They even served wine during lunch time, which I consider as a local cultural distinction xD 
A conference is even nicer if you are not super excited because you are giving a talk yourself, which I had to do on the second day.
Thus, I was not really usable for anything on Monday and Thursday apart from my talk.
Thankfully, my status normalized on Wednesday ;-)
On a conference you finally get to see all the faces behind the names of the authors of the papers you are reading in your daily work. 
Which in the beginning, is a bit intimidating and makes you even more nervous about your talk. 
The BX workshop I was attending gathered some quite big shots (I actually there were more big shots at this workshop than on the main conference :P).
In the the end, I think I managed quite ok with my talk.
I got some interesting questions afterwards, maybe hoped for more questions during the lunch break. 
But I think this is okay, concerning that I am still at the beginning.
And at least I managed to shake some hands, anyways.
Furthermore, I got pointed to get the lecture notes from the BX summer school 2016, which I will think give me a lot of input for the next stages of my work.
Conclusion of my first conference visit? "Nice" experience, a bit strange at first.
I think [this](https://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1335) comic sums it up quite accurately.

One last thing I want to mention is that the conference also led to a really nice and coincidental Bergen-Meet-Up. 
Independent and without knowing from each other, a professor from the University of Bergen was also attending the conference with some of her students
The world can apparently be really small.
Thus, we had a rather surprising encounter on the first conference day, which made the following conference days even nicer:
They had found them self a nice big apartment on AirBnb such that my professor (together with wife and baby) and me simply invited ourselves into their apartment, where we then had a spontaneous dinner party.
It will be definitely become a really positive memory of PhD period.
