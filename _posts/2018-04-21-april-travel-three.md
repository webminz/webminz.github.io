Sorry that these two posts come with one week delay.
I started this lines while waiting at the airports in Thessaloniki, Copenhagen and Oslo, which therefore were a bit _unconnected_. 
Thus, I needed some time to revise them and make them ready to publishing.

## Thessaloniki 

From one of the _nicest_ promenades at the Mediterranean Sea to the _longest_ promenade:
One week in Thessaloniki lies behind me and I am actually looking forward to my flight back to Norway. 
Do not misunderstand that the past week was horrible or something but after two weeks of conferences, sleeping in Hotels, always eating out, and simply being away from my own bed, I have to admit that I am quite a bit exhausted.
Anyways, here is my trip report of last week, which was opposed to some troubles and change of plans in the beginning a quite nice week.

### Report: City

First, some words about the city:
Actually this was not my first time I landed in Thessaloniki.
The first time I just went there to leave the city as far as possible to go kayaking in the Greek mountains. 
Now after being inside, I can safely conclude that the city is actually nicer from the inside as seen from the motorway outside the city.
Especially, if you go to the right places. 
Thessaloniki hosts a lot of run-down buildings and alleys witnessing the suboptimal economic situation in Greece but it also offers a lot of nice cafes and restaurants.
Especially the former "red light district" _Ladadika_ next to the harbor contains a lot of nice restaurants, cafes and bars.
It is definitely worth to spend some if not all your nights here.
A nice thing is that everything is really affordable.
You may eat a lot, have a completely filled table with delicious greek food and still you can get out with around 10 Euros per person.
One thing, which is a bit annoying especially coming from a place like Norway is that the city is really, really _hectic_. 
Thessaloniki counts approx. 1 million inhabitants. And maybe also at least as many cars.
Walking around in Thessaloniki and crossing a street can definitely become a thrilling experience. 
The traffic situation also affected my quality of sleep too a larger extent.
Because I was staying for a full week, I had to pick a quite cheap hotel to not burn all of my travel funds at once. 
The hotel was with respect to its price actually quite ok.
But it was situated downtown right beside the main four lane road in Thessaloniki.
Which made sleeping a bit challenging.
One disappointment with my trip to Thessaloniki actually was that there was again no possibility for bathing. 
Well technically there would have a possibility to jump in the harbor.
But the following picture shows that this might have led to issues regarding my health status.

The fact that while I was a Greece there was one weekend with 20 degrees in Bergen and my flatmates were actually bathing in the sea made my bathing situation even more annoying.
Unfortunately I also did no sightseeing at all because the conference somehow draw all attentions and also my energy.
I just managed to make some pictures of the more important places.
Maybe I have to come back some day and spend some more time in this interesting city.
Here some some random impressions:

### Report: Conference

But actually the cause of my trip was not pleasure but business.
Thus, here some words on the current edition of the **European Joint Conference on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS)**.
ETAPS is considerably on of the biggest conferences when it comes to more theoretical aspects of _Software_ comprising Theoretical Foundations of Programming Languages, Program Verification and Software Engineering.
Actually I planned to meet with my external supervisor from Germany there but he had an unfortunate sudden accident preventing him from coming.
Thus, I was on my own in Thessaloniki.
But it was not that bad, I still made some acquaintances though (mostly with German fellow researchers :D) and listened to some interesting talks.
I also made some interesting observations:

When meeting Software practitioners and also in my department I am usually confronted with the allegation that what I am doing is way too theoretical and quite far away from practice.
Actually a few weeks ago I had to write an essay about my PhD project where I had to relate my activities to philosophy of science and had to ask myself: Is there some evidence about practical relevance?
After ETAPS I must say that I am actually quite practical compared to other researchers.
In spite of being a keen supporter of the pure elegance of theory, I think that some of the talks there are actually way too far away from what is happing in practice. 
I had to think about the really nice essay from Joseph Goguen (A theoretical computer science) [Tossing Algebraic Flowers down the Great Divide](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~goguen/pps/tcs97.pdf), where he reflects about his own work.
Concluding that theoretical computer science is outperformed by its applications.
And I think that this form of conferences does not do anything to stop this trend rather it might amplify it.
My impressions, which started to form while attending &lt;Programming&gt; in Nice, that the concept of a conference is maybe outdated and yielding only limited value got confirmed in Greece.
Let me elaborate this further.
First for those of who do not know how a conference is comprised:
A conference consists of several sessions (before lunch, after lunch, after coffee), which become less engaging the later it gets :-P
One session consists of several presentations (usually 4 times 30 minutes).
A presentation is given from one of the authors of an accepted paper and should somehow give a teaser about the contents of the paper (Usually nobody reads the other papers before).
If there is a bad combination of really specific/complicated topic, bad slides and mediocre presentation skills (which is not unlikely) most people stop listening after five minutes and start answering emails on their pc or working on their own presentations.
When the presentation is finished, the session chair (i.e. a moderator for the course of the session) has to _invent_ some questions if no one else was listening and has questions.
Thus, I also discussed with some other people, the current concept of a conference where everyone is just holding their presentation for themselves while no one else is listening, might be worth dying.
I admit that there is a need to meet fellow researchers but maybe a different format might be more adequate, where scientist actually have to interact with each other. 
When it comes to publication, the traditional way of journal publications might be more reasonable (and better for the environment as it takes away this crazy effort of flight travels).
