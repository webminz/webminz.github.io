It has been quite a while since i did my last post on this site. 
And actually i am quite sorry for this but ... yeah ... actually I think I was little bit busy with _living_.
So, it is nearly November, I am still alive and I am doing quite well at the moment ;-)

In the meantime, some things happened.
I eventually managed to get my person number, I have a Norwegian bank account now, I am capable of mumbling a bit of Norwegian in day to day situations and I also received my first salary. 
Thus, things have become a lot easier.
From the moment you get all these kind of formal things up and running, you really can enjoy you life here.
There is plethora of cultural events, cosy caf√©s and modern trainings facilities here in Bergen.

But most important: i finally got the opportunity go kayaking again.
A few weeks ago i was sea kayaking with local student sports club [BSI](http://bsipadling.no/english_version/).
Even though it was *only* seak kayaking, which i originally considered to be a bit boring, it was great to be on the water after a long time.
The surroundings of Bergen and the North Sea made it into an amazing trip.


But nots not all, last weekend i finally got the chance for a final whitewater kayaking this year:
I finally visited _Voss_, which is sometimes referred to as the whitewater kayaking capital of Europe.
And i must admit that the name is absolutely vindicated.
I rented the whole gear at the guys from [Kayak Voss](http://www.kayakvoss.net/), which by the way are highly recommended and definitely _the_ address when searching for a guide on the rivers around Voss.
So, the locals took me on _Strandelva_ and _Jordalsevla_.
This was really amazing, the amount of (_icy_) water, the slides, the drops, the waterfalls =)
The following picture gives a quick impression about i was talking about:

Besides all this nice activities, of course, i am also working a lot ;-)
The environment at [HVL](www.hvl.no) is really nice, even though it seems that a lot of things are also quite new for the people there (fyi: Their PhD programme just got accredited at the start of this year), things work out quite nicely.
Also, i think that I have a good idea for my research proposal now and therefore know a bit better what I am going to do the next four years.
Of course, I will present this to you in more detail soon.
But for the moment I will have to leave it to you just as an announcement.

Just wait a little bit more (but hopefully not 1,5 months again ;-)) until I added some final touches on it...
