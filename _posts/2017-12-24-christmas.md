The year is nearly over and therefore it is the time to wish you, my family, friends, (former and current)colleges, supervisors and professors a merry, merry Christmas! 

Even though, 2017 for some might be not so full of good memories, especially when looking at some worrying political events out there, for me, 2017 was amazing and full of so many impressions: I quit a job, left Hanover, left Germany, left my family and friends to start a PhD in a country I never have been to before. 
A really big thank to all of you who helped me with my start in Norway, in Bergen, at HVL! You made it a lot easier and a lot more fun! And also a big thank you to all my friends back in Hanover, who gave me hearty welcome now during my Christmas vacation in Germany! 

I wish all of you and your beloved ones a nice, cosy and peaceful Christmas and a good start in a hopefully even better year 2018!

_Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!_
