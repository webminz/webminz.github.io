Wow, it's actual hard to believe but it has been more than one week now since i left Hanover and came to Norway.
A lot of things have changed but some things are quite the same as back in Germany.
All in all, i still might be a bit too overwhelmed by all this new impressions but i will try summarize a few things, which i experience as quite different.
So, here is my (opinionated and uncomplete) list of some (cultural) differences:

- Norway is one of the richest countries on earth and you actually experience this fact the hard way when entering a supermarket: Everything is really expensive. 
In the beginning you will likely try to convert the amount into a known currency. But you should stop doing this early, it will only put you in a bad mood ;-)
- Almost no one is using cash. Actually you will feel very alien whilst paying with cash. Everywhere you go, even when ordering a beer in the pub you pay with your credit card.
- This leads directly to the next major difference: _Alcohol_. Basically you can only buy it in a special governmental owned shop, the _Vinmonopolet_, 
which opening hours are nearly impossible to step by when you are having a 9 to 5 job.
Not to mention that the prices are also not very affordable at all.
- When looking at traffic in Norway it feels like almost every second car is an electric one, which is due to the tax benefits you'll get by buying an electric car.
There is also a high amount of _Teslas_ driving around.
- And finally are quite confusing thing: Beside the regular door handle there is usually a small additional handle, which is used to lock the door. 
But the confusing part is that you actually have to turn it into the other direction opposed to the direction which you are used from the rest of europe.

Now, to answer a questions: "Do i like it?" I'll have to say "Yes!" 
I am living in a real nice appartment next to the city center together with a bunch of really nice norwegian people. 
Every major cultural spot is reachable from home in a short walking distance. 
Also it just takes barely 40 minutes from the front door on the top of one the surrounding mountains, which provide a stunning view over Bergen, the _fjell_ and the Atlantic Sea.
Last weekend there was actually really nice weather (rare occasion in Bergen) and so we took the advantage of this opportunity for a hike in mountains,
or how they will call it _helgetur_.

And to answer the more important question: "How is the new job?" In Norwegian one would say: "Helt fantastisk"
At the moment i have to acknowledge that it was the right decision to take this step and start a _Ph.D._. 
I have now have this unique opportunity to really get into a topic i am actually quite interested in and to maybe shape
a scientific area, which i am studying for more than six years now. 
Also the environment at _Høgskulen på Vestlandet (HVL)_ is really nice, the facilities are very modern,
there are also a lot of other PhD students, who started at the same time and who are working on more or less similar research fields like me. 
This enables easy interchange of ideas and gives rise to new insights about different interesting topics.
Beside my own research work i am a teaching assistant in a computer lab for J2EE development for Bachelor students,
which is a nice practical distraction from my theoretical work. 
Furthermore they organise special lectures for us PhD students at HVL.
One of these courses has just started and is concerned with _Model-Driven Software Engineering (MDSE)_,
which serves as a good starting point for my work as well.
So, to subsume i think there will be times when i will regret throwing myself into the stress of a PhD, 
but currently this moment seems to be far away. Such that, i am just enjoying the moment for now.

But nonetheless, it would be a bit dubious only mentioning positive things. Of course not everything is perfect here. 
Actually on my first day at work there was no computer for me (at least i had i place to sit;-)), it took a few hours to get access to
the internal network and even one more day to get a key card, but i guess this is just the way, successful businesses introduce new employees to their new work environment 
(Maybe some of my old colleagues will spot some similarities). I just thought that these kind of things are different in Norway than in Germany, but apparently they are not :P

And finally the one thing, which is quite annoying for someone who is completely new in a scandinavian country is the _fødselnsummer_. 
A personal unique ID number, which is actually needed for almost everything someone wants to do when working and living in Norway: opening a bank account,
signing a mobile contract, etc.
To get this number, one has to register himself as a new citizen and has to show up for an appointment at the norwegian immigration office, the *UDI*. 
For a citizen of the EU with an employment contract it might not be to difficult to get a residence permit, though these appointment are quite rare
and one has to wait for quite a long time. 
But i hope that this is just a phase one has to go through before finally becoming a real Norwegian citizen.

Thanks for reading. I hope to write more soon.
