Finally... i dit it. I started my own blog. Despite the fact that originally haven't been a big fan of _blogs_ in general, i eventually discarded my former aversion towards this kind of media.
I have to acknowledge that is maybe the best way to write about my work and research and also keep my former colleagues, my friends and family informed about my new life in the North. 
So, unfortunately this is already all for the moment.
Stay tuned for further post, which are hopefully to come in the future ;-)

Cheers, 
Patrick
