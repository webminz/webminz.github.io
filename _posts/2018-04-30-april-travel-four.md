Finally, I am back in Norway, back in _the weather_ ;-P

My journey across Europe concluded in a really nice weekend with _canoe polo_ in Trondheim.
Instead of taking a plane from Thesssaloniki directly back to Bergen, I boarded one to Trondheim. 
The local club there had organized a small tournament in small swimming pool in Stjørdal next close to the Trondheim airport. 
Thus, I landed in TRD, took a short walk from the airport to Stjørdal and hopped right into the kayak.
It was a bit tough to participate in fast canoe polo play after approx. 5h of flights and more than three weeks without any sport or exercise at all. 
But it was **great**. As we are usually not enough people for a proper game in our Sunday morning trainings in Bergen, it was great to simply be able to play again.   
I played in a rather mixed them, we were two players from Bergen, one from Oslo, and another two from Trondheim. 
Of course we played not the best matches as this was the first time playing together but at least we did not become last in the tournament :D

Two things I experienced here:
First the canoe polo community in Norway is rather small and really international. 
The tournament was attended by five teams in total (which is already the majority of all canoe players in Norway i heard), four teams (ours included) consisting of mainly non-Norwegian. Just one team, the junior team from Oslo Kayak Klubb consisted just of Norwegians. 
Secondly the level is not that high, even though I was a bit rusted and also would consider myself with respect to the level in German (University?) canoe polo as _mediocre_, I think I played above average.
Thus, the level of National Norwegian canoe polo is approx. as University fun league in Germany.

The tournament finished on Sunday and I even stayed on day longer until Monday because the flights were cheaper then. 
This gave me the opportunity to see a bit of Trondheim and also the really nice _Pirbadet_, where the local club is training. 
It seems that most of the kayak clubs have really nice possibilities to train in luxurious swimming pools (compared to Germany).
It is kind of a shame that these clubs still struggling in terms of finding new players.
The Trondheim club still seems to be one of the biggest ones led by (of course) a German girl. 
Once more a big thank you to Sofie and her _samboer_ Anton for the sleeping opportunity at their place and the nice tournament in Trondheim. 
See you on the next canoe polo event in Norway!

But for now I am finally quite tired and I am happy to be back in Bergen =)
