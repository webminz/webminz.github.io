## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile.jpg">

Hi! I am a Software Engineer and Computer Science Researcher. Currently, I am working as an assistant professor (_høgskulelektor_) at the [Western Norway University of Applied Sciences (HVL)](https://www.hvl.no/). From 01/01/2022, I will be working with [Digitization](https://geek-and-poke.com/geekandpoke/2016/12/12/hype-cycle) in [Pathology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology) at [Helse Bergen](https://helse-bergen.no/) as a postdoctoral researcher.

Previously, I had been a PhD research fellow at HVL and before that I have had positions as a software engineer at different companies in Germany.


## Research Interests

My research interests span various domains of Computer Science and Software Engineering.
One of my main goals is to turn theoretical research results into practically relevant tools and methods in order to improve the quality of software products.
My focus lies on the following areas:

- Interoperability and Software System Integration
- Model-Driven Software Engineering and Automation
- Process Modeling and Optimization
- Data Management: ETL-Pipelines, Privacy, Anonymization, Governannce 
- Theoretical Foundations of Software Modeling: Universal Algebra and Category Theory
