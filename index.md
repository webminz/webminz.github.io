## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile.jpg">

Hi! I am Computer Science Researcher working as an Associate Professor (or _Førsteamanuensis_ as they call it in Norwegian) at the [Western Norway University of Applied Sciences (short: HVL)](https://www.hvl.no/person/?user=Patrick.Stuenkel).

Simulataneously, I am also employed as a part-time researcher at the [University Hospital](https://helse-bergen.no/), where I am working on _workflow optimization_ in the context of a [Digitization](https://geek-and-poke.com/geekandpoke/2016/12/12/hype-cycle) project in [Pathology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology), called [PiV](https://helse-bergen.no/piv).

My PhD, I wrote on the topic of _Software Interoperability_ and _Consistency Management_. The thesis openly accessible [here](https://hvlopen.brage.unit.no/hvlopen-xmlui/handle/11250/2837740).

Before coming to Norway, I have had positions as a software engineer at different companies in Germany (insurance and output management).

## Research Interests

My research interests span various domains of Computer Science and Software Engineering with a particular focus on applications in the health care domain.
One of my main goals is to turn theoretical research results into practically relevant tools and methods in order to improve the quality of software products.
My focus lies on the following areas:

- Interoperability and Software System Integration
- Model-Driven Software Engineering and Automation
- Process Modeling and Optimization
- Data Management: ETL-Pipelines, Privacy, Anonymization, Governannce 
- Theoretical Foundations of Software Modeling: Universal Algebra and Category Theory
