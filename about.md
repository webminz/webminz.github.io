<div class="post">
	<h1 class="pageTitle">About Me</h1>
	<p class="intro">Hei ! I am a researcher, software engineer and kayaker from Germany currently living in Norway.</p>
	<p>At the moment i am pursuing a PhD in computer science at the <a href="http://www.hvl.no">H&oslash;gskolen p&aring; Vestlandet</a>, 
	 where am working on the field of <em>Model Driven Software Engineering</em>. I am deeply convinced that this way of putting
	 <em>models</em> in the first place is the best way to produce reliable, understandable und correct software in a cost-efficient way.
	 Which in turn i assume is a crucial challenge in the 21st century as ICT-systems have become pervasive in our day to day life. 
	 To reach this goal i am highly interested in the different aspects of MDSE and its theoretical foundations.
	</p>
	<p> On this site i am blogging about my work and research but also about general things, which are coming to my mind while living in Norway ;-)</p>
	<h2>My research interets include the following: </h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Model Driven Software Engineering</li>
		<li>Functional Programming</li>
		<li>Theoretical Foundations of Computer Science</li>
		<li>Programming Languages and Domain Specific Languages</li>
		<li>Category Theory</li>
		<li>Message Oriented Systems</li>
   </ul>
